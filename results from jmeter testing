Conclusions from each test:


simple all - 500 times- 2 threads
	All steps - mongo takes less time and has less std dev
simple all - 1000 times - 5 threads
	same as 500 times - 2 threads
create project - 1000 times- 5 threads
	mongo better. same reason.
update project - 1000 times 1 thread
	pg is better. it has less variation and is faster
update project - 1000 times 5 threads
	pg is 10 times faster. also less variation. much better. makes sense.
get current
	mongo faster. less variation
get historical
	mongo faster. less variation
